Features and limitations
------------------------

* The available functions should be suitable for finding "red days" in any calendar.

* Currently, only the Norwegian calendar has been fully implemented, but more languages and locales can be added.

* The US calendar is almost done, but is a work in progress.

* Implementing additional calendars is relatively easy.


TODO
----

* Support for other languages and locales
